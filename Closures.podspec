    Closures is an iOS Framework that adds closure handlers to many of the popular
    UIKit and Foundation classes. Although this framework is a substitute for 
    some Cocoa Touch design patterns, such as Delegation and Data Sources, and 
    Target-Action, the authors make no claim regarding which is a better way to 
    accomplish the same type of task. Most of the time it is a matter of style, 
    preference, or convenience that will determine if any of these closure extensions 
    are beneficial.
    
    Whether youâ€™re a functional purist, dislike a particular API, or simply just 
    want to organize your code a little bit, you might enjoy using this library.
